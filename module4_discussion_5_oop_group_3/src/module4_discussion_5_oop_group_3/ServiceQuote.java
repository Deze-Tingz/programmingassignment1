Date: October 26th 2023
Assignment: Create a Java program that will implement Object Oriented basic concepts.
Instructor: Sergio Pisano
Description: Replicate in Eclipse the program explained in the video lectures showing the following classes: 
			Cars, Customer, ServiceQuote, and MyDriverClass. Place a few breakpoints at the start of the program and run it
			in debug mode step-by-step. Observe how the program progresses, the value of variables, objects, and the 
			object-oriented model at work. Make note of which section is executed first and why, etc.
